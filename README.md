# Vogel-Fetkovich_IPR_Analyser
This project provides a Python-based tool for analyzing Inflow Performance Relationships (IPR) of saturated oil reservoirs. It implements Vogelâ€™s empirical model and the generalized Fetkovich equation (n=2) to estimate well productivity under varying bottom-hole flowing pressures. The tool also incorporates skin factor correction and reservoir geometry (drainage and wellbore radius) to calculate an effective Productivity Index (PI).

The program allows to:
-Input reservoir pressure, test data, and reservoir parameters.
-Compare Vogel and Fetkovich IPR curves.
-Visualize flow rate vs. bottom-hole pressure with matplotlib.
-Evaluate the effect of skin damage or stimulation on well productivity.
